						<p>We know travel is not just about visiting the places.

						<p>Maybe, it's about rekindling the sense of wonder and curiosity
						 which each one of us has. Maybe, it's about appreciating the beauty 
						 and the starkly different perspectives the world has to offer.</p>

						<p>Maybe, it meeting interesting people and meaningful friendships. 
						Maybe, it's about immersing completely in a new culture. Maybe, it's 
						about learning or creating something you never imagined before. Maybe, 
						it's about overcoming your fears.</p>

						<p>Maybe, it's about going back as a changed person. 
						Maybe, it's about making the world a better place.</p>

						<p>We want to bring about the concept of creative travel and tourism,
						 where we move away from consumeristic tourism to a much more experiential,
						  authentic and locally embedded form of tourism.</p>

						<p>As a visitor, it offers you a way to indulge deeply in a 
						creative pursuit or a story, connect with the locals, meet new 
						people and make meaningful connections. It provides you an 
						opportunity to learn and create something new, explore a new 
						place, spend time with yourself and experience newer perspectives.</p>

						<p>We wish to provide you immersive journeys across various 
						themes which will ignite your curiosity and creativity.</p>

						<p>We also love nature. We love the sanctity of snow capped 
						mountains, and we love the seas. We love the thrill of the fast 
						flowing rivers. Through our personal experiences, as well 
						through what research indicates, we have come to understand that 
						spending time and being close to nature brings a long lasting joy, 
						fulfilment and well-being. We wish to provide you experiences 
						which will nourish your soul, make you fitter, help you overcome 
						your fears and at the same time, doing it all responsibly.</p>

						<p>Today, there is a growing need to make responsible travel 
						choices so that the places which we visit are left better off, 
						environmentally, culturally and economically as well as at an 
						individual level.</p>

						<p>Through simple choices, like choosing local homestays, sharing 
						and learning skills, appreciating and celebrating a different way 
						of life with the hosts, we can leave a behind a positive impact through
						 our travel. Such experiences also leave visitors with valuable memories,
						  skill and stories. </p>

						<p>We see how creative tourism can make travel a force for
